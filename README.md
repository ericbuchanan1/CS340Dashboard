How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, especially when integrating a CRUD Python module with dashboard widgets for database interactions, highlights several advantages:

Maintainability: By encapsulating database operations within the CRUD module, changes to database schema or operations require adjustments in only one place. This approach simplifies maintenance, as developers can update, debug, or enhance database interactions without sifting through the entire codebase.

Readability: A well-structured CRUD module with clear function names and documentation makes it easier for new developers or collaborators to understand how the application interacts with the database. This clarity improves the onboarding process and facilitates collaborative development.

Adaptability: The CRUD module's abstraction allows the rest of the application to interact with the database through a consistent interface, even if the underlying database technology changes. This flexibility ensures that adapting to new requirements or technologies involves minimal disruptions to the application's core functionality.

The CRUD module can be used universally, and adapted in different ways. Based off the current adaptation it has some specifics to this current project, but with some small updates such as changing AnimalShelter to something more generic like CRUD_module would allow it to be easily adaptable to any program. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

In approaching the project for Grazioso Salvare, the process was iterative and user-centric, focusing on understanding their specific needs and how the application could best serve those requirements. Unlike more straightforward assignments, this project required a blend of technical skills and creative problem-solving, ensuring the final product was not only functional but also user-friendly and aligned with Grazioso Salvare's objectives.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

The role of a computer scientist is to solve complex problems, create systems that are efficient at processing and analyzing data, and make tools that make us more productive. To find trends and patterns, they develop algorithms, do simulations, and analyze data. In addition to creating systems for storing, managing, and supporting decision-making processes, computer scientists also create cybersecurity solutions. By combining their math, computer science, and software engineering skills, they're able to solve complex problems. Also, they can create systems to store and manage data, and support decision-making processes, as well as design and analyze data to identify trends and patterns. As well, they make sure data is protected and systems are secure by developing and maintaining cyber security solutions.
